Hi, I'm Kiegan! I'm currently a graduate research assistant at the Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence (CSAFE). I recently earned my Ph.D. in Statistics from Iowa State University, working with Dr. Heike Hofmann and Dr. Ulrike Genschel. I studied computational and statistical reproducibility of data science pipelines, with a focus on forensic firearms analysis.  

I am passionate about using data to better the world around me, and I think data visualization and storytelling are some of the most powerful tools at our disposal as data scientists.
