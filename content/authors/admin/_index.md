Hi, I'm Kiegan! I recently earned my Ph.D. in Statistics from Iowa State University, working with Dr. Heike Hofmann and Dr. Ulrike Genschel. My primary research topic was computational and statistical reproducibility of data science pipelines. I demonstrated my research methods using a statistical analysis process for forensic bullet comparisons, but data science pipelines are applicable in a wide variety of fields. At the moment, I am working as a graduate research assistant at the Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence (CSAFE) to make public my packages that support reproducible research in R, and submit manuscripts on my graduate research.  

I am passionate about using data to better the world around me. Data-driven decision making can have a hugely positive impact on any organization, and it is even more important when those decisions can impact policy, health and well-being, and social good. Data visualization and storytelling are some of the most powerful tools data scientists wield in their tool belt, and communicating complex ideas to a variety of audiences is an underrated skill.  

I am currently looking for a position where I can put my data, communication, and organizational skills to use for social good. I am eager to dig in and use data to make a difference.
