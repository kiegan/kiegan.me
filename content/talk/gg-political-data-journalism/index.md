abstract: In today's day and age, U.S. society is inundated with information about politics and elections from all around the world. Particularly in a U.S. Presidential election year, the news is full of predictions, results, and stories about the primary and Presidential elections. The key to effectively communicating a message about election data lies in graphical presentation of statistical information. In this talk, I will present a history of innovation in election graphics including results, predictions, voter turnout, and campaigns and advertising.
